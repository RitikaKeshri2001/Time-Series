    "### Q1. What is a time series, and what are some common applications of time series analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series is a sequence of data points spread over a specific duration of time, where time is the independent variable and other variables are not constant. The time-series data is analyzed over a regular temporal interval. Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing this data to understand the underlying causes of trends or patterns over time. Time series analysis can also be used for forecastingâ€”predicting future data based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common applications of time series analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finance: Time series analysis can help investors and analysts track the price movements of securities, currencies, commodities, etc. over time and identify patterns, cycles, seasonality, etc. that can inform trading decisions.\n",
    "- Retail: Time series analysis can help retailers understand the demand and sales of their products over time and adjust their inventory, pricing, marketing, etc. accordingly. Time series analysis can also help retailers forecast future sales and revenue based on historical data.\n",
    "- Economics: Time series analysis can help economists measure and monitor various macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, etc. over time and analyze their relationships, trends, shocks, etc. Time series analysis can also help economists forecast future economic outcomes based on historical data."

    "### Q2. What are some common time series patterns, and how can they be identified and interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common time series patterns are:\n",
    "1. Trend: A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a trend \"changing direction\" when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.  A trend can show the direction and rate of change of a variable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Seasonal: A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. A seasonal pattern can show the periodic fluctuations of a variable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cyclic: A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period. The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years. A cyclic pattern can show the long-term oscillations of a variable over time. A cyclic pattern is different from a seasonal pattern, which is a rise and fall in the data values that repeats regularly over the same time period. A seasonal pattern always has a fixed and known frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Noise: A noise pattern in time series is a pattern of random fluctuations that do not have any discernible structure or dependency in the data. The data points are independent and identically distributed with a mean of zero. A noise pattern can show the unpredictable variations of a variable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify and interpret these patterns, a useful first step is to construct a time series plot. A time series plot is a graphical presentation of the relationship between time and the time series variable; time is on the horizontal axis and the time series values are shown on the vertical axis. By visually inspecting the plot, one can get an idea of whether there is a trend, seasonality, cycle, or noise pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful step is to apply some statistical tests or decomposition methods to confirm or quantify the patterns in the data. For example, one can use a unit root test to check if there is a trend in the data, or use an autocorrelation function to check if there is seasonality or cycle in the data. One can also use methods such as classical decomposition or STL decomposition to separate the data into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and noise components."

    "### Q3. How can time series data be preprocessed before applying analysis techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data can be preprossed before applying analysis techniques as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting values into dates: Time series data should have a date or time stamp associated with each observation. Sometimes, the date or time values may be stored as text or numbers, which makes it difficult for Python to recognize them as dates or times. To fix this, one can use the to_datetime method from pandas to convert the values into a date time type\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values: Time series data may have missing values due to various reasons, such as errors in data collection, transmission, or storage. Missing values can affect the accuracy and validity of time series analysis and forecasting. To deal with missing values, one can use various methods, such as deleting them, replacing them with zeros, means, medians, or previous or next values, or using interpolation or imputation techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing outliers: Outliers can distort the patterns and trends in time series data and affect the performance of time series models. To remove outliers, one can use various methods, such as deleting them, replacing them with means, medians, or previous or next values, or using robust statistics or outlier detection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accounting for seasonality and trend(Convert non stationary to stationary): Seasonality and trend are systematic patterns of variation in time series data that can affect the analysis and forecasting of the data. Seasonality is a periodic fluctuation that repeats over a fixed and known period, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Trend is a long-term increase or decrease in the data over time. To account for seasonality and trend, one can use various methods, such as differencing, detrending, deseasonalizing, decomposition, or transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If necessary then normalize the data\n",
    "- Split the data into train and test data."

    "- Data quality: Time series forecasting relies on the quality and reliability of the historical data used to train the forecast models. However, the data may be incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, noisy, or outdated due to various reasons, such as errors in data collection, transmission, storage, or processing. Data quality issues can affect the accuracy and validity of time series forecasting and lead to poor business decisions.\n",
    "- Model complexity: Time series forecasting involves choosing and fitting an appropriate model that can capture the patterns and trends in the data. However, the choice and complexity of the model may depend on various factors, such as the length, frequency, seasonality, stationarity, linearity, and noise of the data. Choosing and fitting a suitable model may require domain knowledge, statistical expertise, computational resources, and trial-and-error.\n",
    "- Model uncertainty: Time series forecasting involves making assumptions and estimations about the future based on the past. However, the future may not always follow the same patterns or trends as the past due to various factors, such as changes in customer behavior, market conditions, competitor actions, regulatory policies, etc. These factors may introduce uncertainty and variability in the forecast results and reduce their confidence and reliability."

    "### Q5. What is ARIMA modelling, and how can it be used to forecast time series data?\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA modelling is a statistical method for time series forecasting that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. ARIMA modelling can capture various patterns and structures in time series data, such as trends, seasonality, cycles, and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ARIMA model has three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AutoRegressive (AR): This component captures the dependence between an observation and some number of lagged observations. For example, an AR(1) model means that the current observation is dependent on the previous observation. An AR(2) model means that the current observation is dependent on the previous two observations, and so on. The number of lagged observations is called the **order** of the AR component and is denoted by **p**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrated (I): This component captures the amount of differencing needed to make the time series stationary. A stationary time series is one that has constant mean and variance over time, and no seasonality or trend. Differencing is a process of subtracting the current observation from the previous observation, or a higher order difference if needed. The number of differences needed is called the **degree** of differencing and is denoted by **d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving Average (MA): This component captures the dependence between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. A moving average model is one that uses a weighted sum of past observations as a prediction for the current observation. The residual error is the difference between the actual observation and the predicted observation. The number of residual errors is called the **order** of the MA component and is denoted by **q**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ARIMA model can be written as ARIMA(p,d,q), where p, d, and q are the orders of the AR, I, and MA components respectively. For example, an ARIMA(1,0,1) model means that it has an AR(1) component, no differencing (d=0), and an MA(1) component.\n",
    "\n",
    "To forecast time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare the data: The data should be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any outliers, missing values, or noise. The data should also be transformed if needed to make it more stationary or normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the model: The orders of p, d, and q should be identified based on various methods, such as plotting the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), using information criteria (such as AIC or BIC), or using grid search or auto-arima methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the model: The parameters of the ARIMA model should be estimated based on some optimization or maximum likelihood methods. The estimated model should be checked for its adequacy and validity using various diagnostic tests and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecast the model: The estimated model can be used to forecast future values of the time series based on some confidence interval or prediction error. The forecast accuracy can be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)."

    "### Q7. What are the assumptions of ARIMA models, and how can they be tested for in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the assumptions of ARIMA models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stationarity: The time series should have a constant mean and variance over time, and no trend or seasonality. Stationarity can be checked by plotting the time series, using summary statistics, or performing statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test or the KPSS test. If the time series is not stationary, it can be transformed by using differencing, detrending, deseasonalizing, or other methods.\n",
    "- Univariate: ARIMA models work on a single variable that is influenced by its own past values and some random error. If there are other predictor variables that affect the outcome variable, ARIMA models may not be appropriate. In that case, ARIMAX models or other multivariate models may be used.\n",
    "- Linearity: ARIMA models assume that the relationship between the outcome variable and its lagged values is linear. If there is evidence of non-linearity in the data, ARIMA models may not fit well. In that case, non-linear models, such as NARIMA or ARCH/GARCH models may be used.\n",
    "- Normality: ARIMA models assume that the error terms are normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance. Normality can be checked by using histograms, Q-Q plots, or statistical tests, such as the Jarque-Bera test or the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the error terms are not normally distributed, they can be transformed by using Box-Cox transformation or other methods."

    "\n",
    "Some limitations of Time series analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical Dependence: Time series analysis assumes that future observations are dependent on past observations. This assumption may not hold true in scenarios where the underlying dynamics of the time series change abruptly, leading to a breakdown in the historical relationships. The historical data may be incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, noisy, or outdated due to various reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Sensitivity to Outliers: Outliers, extreme values, or unexpected events in the time series can significantly impact the analysis and forecasting results. Time series models are sensitive to such outliers, and if they are not properly identified and addressed, they can distort the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data quantity: Time series analysis requires a sufficient amount of data to capture the patterns and trends in the data. However, the data may be scarce, sparse, or irregular due to various reasons, such as limited availability, high cost, or low frequency of data collection. Data quantity issues can affect the stability and generalizability of time series models and lead to overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example of a scenario where the limitations of time series analysis may be particularly relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting stock market prices: Stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, such as economic indicators, company news, geopolitical events, investor sentiment, and market trends. Time series analysis alone may not adequately capture the complex and interdependent nature of these factors, making it challenging to accurately predict stock prices solely based on historical price data. Additionally, the stock market is highly dynamic and can experience sudden shifts, extreme volatility, and non-linear patterns, which can pose challenges for traditional time series models. Unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, major policy changes, or unexpected company-specific events, can disrupt historical relationships and render traditional time series models less effective."
